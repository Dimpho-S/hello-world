# hello-world

Hi everone

I am excited to start this new journey of programming and coding. I'm hoping that it wont be too long from now that I'll have a moreconcrete understanding of everything.
Ny hobbies are sketching, singing and plaing violin, hopefully I'll be able to add coding to that list pretty soon.
I enjoy reading and gyming, part of my let-go activities.
My favourite muic genre is R&B.

I hope all goes well in this new journey.
